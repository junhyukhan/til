# TIL (today I learned)
This repository will contain the things I have learned today.

## The structure
The notes will be organized in folders depending on their subject, and subfolders should be limited as much as possible.

## The process
1. During the day, take handwritten notes whenever I have come across a new thing. This can be as small as a stackoverflow thread, a new vim command, or a new VS code extension that seems useful.
1. Transfer the handwritten notes on to this repo.
